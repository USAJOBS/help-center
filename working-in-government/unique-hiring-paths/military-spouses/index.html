    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Receives a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) move.</li>
      <li>Has a 100% disability rating.</li>

    </p>
    <p>
      Your eligibility does not entitle you to a job within the Federal Government. You must still apply and meet qualification standards and additional requirements, such as a background investigation.
