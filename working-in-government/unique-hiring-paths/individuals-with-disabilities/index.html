    <p>The Federal Government hires each person using a hiring authority (the term comes from the Federal regulation that describes it). Federal agencies can use the Schedule A Hiring Authority to hire an individual with a disability.</p>

            Schedule A Hiring Authority

          <div id="schedule-a" aria-hidden="true" class="usa-accordion-content usajobs-uhp-accordion-content">
            <p>Schedule A refers to a special hiring authority that gives Federal agencies an optional, and potentially quicker, way to hire individuals with disabilities.  Applying under Schedule A offers an exception to the traditional competitive hiring process. You can apply for jobs using Schedule A, if you are a person with an intellectual disability, a severe physical disability, or a psychiatric disability.</p>

            <p>To be eligible for Schedule A, you must provide a "proof of a disability" letter stating that you have an intellectual disability, severe physical disability or psychiatric disability. You can get this letter from your doctor, a licensed medical professional, a licensed vocational rehabilitation specialist, or any federal, state, or local agency that issues or provides disability benefits.</p>

            <p>Applying using "Schedule A" can be a great way to get a Federal job, but it is only one of many options that may be available and you still have to compete with other eligible applicants.  Federal agencies hire people using many options, so applying under "Schedule A" does not guarantee you a job.</p>

    <p>
      Selective Placement Program Coordinators (SPPC) help agencies recruit, hire, and accommodate people with disabilities. The SPPC can guide you through the application process and answer questions. Most federal agencies, but not all, have an SPPC or equivalent role, such as a Special Emphasis Program Manager.

      If you are a disabled person and interested in a job opportunity, contact the agency SPPC using the <a class="usajobs-help-center__external-link" href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/disability-employment/selective-placement-program-coordinator-directory/">Selected Placement Program Coordinator directory <span class="fa fa-external-link"></span></a>.

      Accommodating Individuals with Disabilities
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="usajobs-uhp-section__col-right">
    <p>
      Federal agencies are required by law to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified applicants and employees with disabilities, unless doing so will result in undue hardship to the agency. The accommodations make it easier for an employee, with a disability, to successfully perform the duties of the position. For example, an agency may offer:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interpreters, readers, or other personal assistance</li>
      <li>Modified position duties</li>
      <li>Flexible work schedules or work sites</li>
      <li>Accessible technology or other workplace adaptive equipment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You can request reasonable accommodations any time during the hiring process or at any time while on the job. Requests are considered on a case-by-case basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      To request a reasonable accommodation:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Look at the job posting for instructions on requesting a reasonable accommodation.</li>
      <li>Work directly with the person arranging the interviews.</li>
      <li>Contact the agency SPPC.</li>
      <li>Request a reasonable accommodation verbally or in writing; no special language is needed.</li>
    </ol>
