If you're a current federal employee in the competitive service, you may transfer to another competitive job in another agency by applying to a job that is open to federal employees. You will not have to compete against the general public.  Your transfer eligibility does not guarantee you will get the job – you will still compete against other federal employees who apply and you must meet the qualifications and other requirements.

If you transfer to another job, you’ll keep your "time in service" as long as you start the new job without missing a day of work.
