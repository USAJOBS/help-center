If you qualify for veterans’ preference, upload your DD-214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty and, if applicable, [SF 15, Application for 10-Point Veterans’ Preference](http://www.opm.gov/Forms/pdf_fill/SF15.pdf). You can also attach your DD-214 or SF 15 to any resume you distribute at a Pathways hiring event.

Learn [how to upload documents](../how-to/account/documents/upload/).

If you’re a veteran, visit http://www.fedshirevets.gov, email fedshirevets@opm.gov or call (202) 606-5090 for Federal hiring assistance.
