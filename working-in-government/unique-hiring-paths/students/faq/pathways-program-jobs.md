Pathways Programs jobs are posted on USAJOBS. You can search for these job opportunities from the [Pathways Programs site](http://www.usajobs.gov/studentsandgrads). You can also use the advanced search feature and select internships or recent graduates under the **Type of Work or Work Schedule**.

Even though Pathways Program  jobs are posted on USAJOBS, you may not be always able to apply online. If the **Apply Online** button is missing or disabled, review the **How to Apply** section of the job opportunity announcement- it will contain application instructions.

The annual [Presidential Management Fellows](http://www.pmf.gov) job opportunity announcement is typically available in the fall.
