The applicant number indicates the number of people who started applying for a job through USAJOBS and continued to the hiring agency to finish the application. The number may not show completed applications.

## When does a job announcement list the number of applicants?

We provide the number of applicants for jobs you have applied for once they have the status [Reviewing Applications or Hiring Complete](../../../how-to/application/status/).

You will not see an applicant count on jobs you have applied for that are canceled or before the job closes to new applicants.

## Why do some jobs list the applicant count and not others?

Right now, we are only listing applicant counts for some jobs at specific hiring agencies to test out this feature.

If you have any feedback on this new feature, please fill out the contact form below.
