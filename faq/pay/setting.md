## If you have no previous civilian service in the Federal Government

A new General Schedule(GS) employee is entitled to have pay set at step 1 of the employee’s grade. An agency may also opt to use the  [superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-administration/fact-sheets/superior-qualifications-and-special-needs-pay-setting-authority/). Under this authority, an agency may set pay up to step 10. An agency may use this authority based on the candidate’s superior qualifications or a special need of the agency for the candidate’s services. An agency must approve each determination to use the superior qualifications and special needs pay-setting authority prior to the candidate entering on duty.

[Contact the employing agency](../../how-to/application/agency/contact/) for information about its policy.

## If you have previous civilian service in the Federal Government

A reemployed GS employee is entitled to have pay set at step 1 of the grade.
