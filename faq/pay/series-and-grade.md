Series and grade refers to the Federal government's system for categorizing and defining jobs. If you have never worked in the Federal government, you do not have to enter a series or grade on your resume for previous, non-government jobs. Upon application, however, you may be prompted to pick the highest grade you desire or are eligible for.

The [GS pay schedule](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/) provides the base schedule and schedules by state. You may also view the [wage scale schedules](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/federal-wage-system/).


## Determining which grade is appropriate

### Just starting out

If you are just starting out, you can qualify for jobs at the GS-2 level with a high school diploma or as little as 3 months of general work experience. At GS-3 and GS-4 levels, you can qualify with more months of general experience. Starting at GS-5, jobs generally require 1 year of specialized experience to qualify.

### Graduates

When you have a degree but no specialized experience in a career field, you are eligible for appointment at the GS-5 pay scale. (If you maintained a B average, or met other academic credentials in college, you can start out at the GS-7 pay scale.)

### Experience

To qualify for jobs at the GS-7 and higher grades, your background must have included experience closely related to the work to be performed in the job for which you are applying

### Advanced degree

You can qualify for GS-9 positions on the basis of a master’s degree, and for GS-11 positions on the basis of a doctorate.

## Steps

A step is a raise in salary. Most grades in the Federal government have 10 steps.
