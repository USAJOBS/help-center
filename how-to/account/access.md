1. Complete the **Contact Us** form at the bottom of the page.
2. In the **Question/Comment** box, include the email address that is associated with your account (this is the email you can’t access) and provide a current email address that you can access. Include other information associated with your account including your username, mailing address, or phone number(s).
3.	Click **Send**.

The USAJOBS Help Desk will send you an email, to the email address you can access, asking for the answers to your security questions. You must reply to the help desk with your answers to regain access to your account.

After you reply to the help desk, they will update the email address in your account and send you another email to your new email address with directions to reset your password.
