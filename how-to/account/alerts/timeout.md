After 30 minutes of inactivity on USAJOBS, users will be timed out. Inactivity counts as time not keying data into the system or actively searching for jobs. If a timeout occurs, any unsaved information entered will not be saved and will be lost. Be sure to save often and prior to leaving the computer for an extended amount of time. Timeouts are for your safety and to prevent information theft.
