Federal experience includes positions you have held as a civilian employee paid by an agency of the Federal government. The pay plan, series, and grade fields refer to Executive Branch competitive positions and are not mandatory fields. If your experience does not fit, simply leave those fields blank.

Active duty military members or experience working for a private contractor of the U.S. government do not qualify as Federal positions for this purpose.
