## Built resumes

To edit a resume that you built using the USAJOBS Resume Builder tool:

1.  Sign into your USAJOBS account.
2.  Go to  **Documents** - your resumes appear in your documents.
3.  Click the **Edit** link for the USAJOBS builder resume you would like to change.
4.  Make your edits and click **Save**. 
5.  Click **Cancel** if you do not want to save your changes.

In the **Select Resume** step of the [USAJOBS Application Process](../../../../application/), you will also have the opportunity to edit your USAJOBS builder resume.

### Deleting a section

If you want to delete an entry in work experience, education, or references, click the red X at the right of the entry link. For help in each section of the resume builder, click the **?** icon in each section.
