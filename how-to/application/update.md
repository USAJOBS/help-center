## Additional Information

* Job announcements that are  “open” are still accepting new applications and updated applications.
* Job announcements that are “closed” are no longer accepting applications or updates to previously submitted applications.
* If you want to update your application with a newer version of your resume or documents or new profile information, you must resubmit the application with the changes- simply updating the information in your USAJOBS account does not "submit" the changes. 
* If you resubmit your application with a newer resume or document, your application may continue to display both old and new information. The agency will review your most recent submission and provide a date/time stamp next to each attachment. Agencies have certain legal requirements for records retention; however, you may request that the agency remove you from consideration or accept changes or additions to your applicaiton by contacting the agency representative listed on the job announcement.
