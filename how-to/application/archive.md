1.	Go into your **Active** application listing.
2.	Find the application you want to archive and click on the **+** to expand the content.
3.	Select the **Archive** icon at the bottom of the application listing. This will move the application from your active list to your archive list.

### To unarchive a job application
1.	Go into your **Archive** application listing.
2.	Find the application you want to unarchive and select the **+** to expand the content.
3.	Select the **Unarchive** button. This will move the application from your archive list to your active list.
